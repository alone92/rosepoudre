Highlights images on hover and adds a Pinterest "Pin It" button over them for easy pinning.

== Description ==
If you're looking for an easy way to pin images in your blog posts and pages, this plugin will help you with that. It highlights images and adds a "Pin it" button over them once the user hovers his mouse over an image. Once the user clicks the "Pin it" button, the plugin shows a pop-up window with the image and a description. Everything is ready for pinning, although the user can alter the description.

The plugin allows you to:

* choose from where the description should be taken (possible options: page title, page description and alt/title tags from the image)
* choose which pictures shouldn't show the "Pin it" button (using classes)
* choose which pictures should show the "Pin it" button (all images, post images, images with certain class(es))
* choose if you want to show the "Pin it" button on home page, single posts, single pages or category pages
* disable showing the button on certain posts and pages (works only on single posts and single pages)
* choose transparency level depending on your needs
* use your own Pinterest button design

Once you activate the plugin, it's ready to go with the typical settings - button appears on all images within the body of your posts/pages that aren't marked with "nopin" or "wp-smiley" classes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I change the plugins settings? =

Configuration interface can be found under `Settings - jQuery Pin It Button For Images`. There's also a link to the plugin settings in the "Installed plugins" menu.

= How do I add the button only to specific images? =
On the plugin settings page, there is a "Enabled classes" setting. Please enter there a class (or classes) that should show the "Pin it" button. Please note that images that don't contain any of the classes added in this setting won't show the "Pin it" button.

= How do I disable the button on specific images? =
Use the "Disabled classes" setting on the settings page - add there specific classes or use the "nopin" class.

= Can I use my own "Pin it" button design? =
 Yes. On the settings page, there's a section named "Custom Pit It button". You need to check the Use custom image checkbox and provide a URL address of the image, image's width and height.

 To upload you own image, you can use **Media Library** on your Wordpress installation or an image hosting service like **Photobucket**. Make sure you provide the proper address, width and height of the image. Otherwise, the button won't be displayed properly or won't be displayed at all.

= Where do I report bugs, improvements and suggestions? =
Please report them in the plugin's support forum on Wordpress.org.
